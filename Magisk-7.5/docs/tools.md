# Magisk Tools
Magisk comes with a huge collections of tools for installation, daemons, and utilities for developers. This documentation covers the 3 binaries and all included applets. The binaries and applets are shown below:

```
magiskboot                 /* binary */
magiskinit                 /* binary */
magiskpolicy -> magiskinit
supolicy -> magiskinit
magisk                     /* binary */
magiskhide -> magisk
resetprop -> magisk
su -> magisk
```

Note: The Magisk zip you download only contains `magiskboot`, `magiskinit`, and `magiskinit64`. The binary `magisk` is compressed and embedded into `magiskinit(64)`. Push `magiskinit(64)` to your device and run `./magiskinit(64) -x magisk <path>` to extract `magisk` out of the binary.

### magiskboot
A tool to unpack / repack boot images, parse / patch / extract cpio, patch dtb, hex patch binaries, and compress / decompress files with multiple algorithms.

`magiskboot` natively supports (which means it does not rely on external tools) common compression formats including `gzip`, `lz4`, `lz4_legacy` ([only used on LG](https://events.static.linuxfound.org/sites/events/files/lcjpcojp13_klee.pdf)), `lzma`, `xz`, and `bzip2`.

The concept of `magiskboot` is to make boot image modification simpler. For unpacking, it parses the header and extracts all sections in the image, decompressing on-the-fly if compression is detected in any sections. For repacking, the original boot image is required so the original headers can be used, changing only the necessary entries such as section sizes and checksum. All sections will be compressed back to the original format if required. The tool also supports many CPIO and DTB operations.

```
Usage: magiskboot <action> [args...]

Supported actions:
  unpack [-h] <bootimg>
    Unpack <bootimg> to, if available, kernel, kernel_dtb, ramdisk.cpio,
    second, dtb, extra, and recovery_dtbo into current directory.
    If '-h' is provided, it will dump header info to 'header',
    which will be parsed when repacking.
    Return values:
    0:valid    1:error    2:chromeos

  repack [-n] <origbootimg> [outbootimg]
    Repack boot image components from current directory
    to [outbootimg], or new-boot.img if not specified.
    If '-n' is provided, it will not attempt to recompress ramdisk.cpio,
    otherwise it will compress ramdisk.cpio and kernel with the same method
    in <origbootimg> if the file provided is not already compressed.

  hexpatch <file> <hexpattern1> <hexpattern2>
    Search <hexpattern1> in <file>, and replace with <hexpattern2>

  cpio <incpio> [commands...]
    Do cpio commands to <incpio> (modifications are done directly)
    Each command is a single argument, use quotes if necessary
    Supported commands:
      exists ENTRY
        Return 0 if ENTRY exists, else return 1
      rm [-r] ENTRY
        Remove ENTRY, specify [-r] to remove recursively
      mkdir MODE ENTRY
        Create directory ENTRY in permissions MODE
      ln TARGET ENTRY
        Create a symlink to TARGET with the name ENTRY
      mv SOURCE DEST
        Move SOURCE to DEST
      add MODE ENTRY INFILE
        Add INFILE as ENTRY in permissions MODE; replaces ENTRY if exists
      extract [ENTRY OUT]
        Extract ENTRY to OUT, or extract all entries to current directory
      test
        Test the current cpio's patch status
        Return values:
        0:stock    1:Magisk    2:unsupported (phh, SuperSU, Xposed)
      patch KEEPVERITY KEEPFORCEENCRYPT
        Ramdisk patches. KEEP**** are boolean values
      backup ORIG
        Create ramdisk backups from ORIG
      restore
        Restore ramdisk from ramdisk backup stored within incpio
      sha1
        Print stock boot SHA1 if previously backed up in ramdisk

  dtb-<cmd> <dtb>
    Do dtb related cmds to <dtb> (modifications are done directly)
    Supported commands:
      dump
        Dump all contents from dtb for debugging
      test
        Check if fstab has verity/avb flags
        Return values:
        0:flag exists    1:no flags
      patch
        Search for fstab and remove verity/avb

  compress[=method] <infile> [outfile]
    Compress <infile> with [method] (default: gzip), optionally to [outfile]
    <infile>/[outfile] can be '-' to be STDIN/STDOUT
    Supported methods: bzip2 gzip lz4 lz4_legacy lzma xz

  decompress <infile> [outfile]
    Detect method and decompress <infile>, optionally to [outfile]
    <infile>/[outfile] can be '-' to be STDIN/STDOUT
    Supported methods: bzip2 gzip lz4 lz4_legacy lzma xz

  sha1 <file>
    Print the SHA1 checksum for <file>

  cleanup
    Cleanup the current working directory
```

### magiskinit
This binary will replace `init` in the ramdisk of a Magisk patched boot image. It is originally created for supporting devices using system-as-root, but the tool is extended to support all devices and became a crucial part of Magisk. More details can be found in the **Pre-Init** section in [Magisk Booting Process](details.md#magisk-booting-process).

### magiskpolicy
(This tool is aliased to `supolicy` for compatibility with SuperSU's sepolicy tool)

An applet of `magiskinit`. This tool could be used for advanced developers to modify SELinux policies. In common scenarios like Linux server admins, they would directly modify the SELinux policy sources (`*.te`) and recompile the `sepolicy` binary, but here on Android we directly patch the binary file (or runtime policies).

All processes spawned from the Magisk daemon, including root shells and all its forks, are running in the context `u:r:magisk:s0`. The rule used on all Magisk installed systems can be viewed as stock `sepolicy` with these patches: `magiskpolicy --magisk 'allow magisk * * *'`.

```
Usage: magiskpolicy [--options...] [policy statements...]

Options:
   --help            show help message for policy statements
   --load FILE       load policies from FILE
   --load-split      load from preloaded sepolicy or compile
                     split policies
   --compile-split   compile split cil policies
   --save FILE       save policies to FILE
   --live            directly apply sepolicy live
   --magisk          inject built-in rules for a minimal
                     Magisk selinux environment

If neither --load or --compile-split is specified, it will load
from current live policies (/sys/fs/selinux/policy)

One policy statement should be treated as one parameter;
this means a full policy statement should be enclosed in quotes;
multiple policy statements can be provided in a single command

The statements has a format of "<rule_name> [args...]"
Multiple types and permissions can be grouped into collections
wrapped in curly brackets.
'*' represents a collection containing all valid matches.

Supported policy statements:

Type 1:
"<rule_name> source_type target_type class perm_set"
Rules: allow, deny, auditallow, dontaudit

Type 2:
"<rule_name> source_type target_type class operation xperm_set"
Rules: allowxperm, auditallowxperm, dontauditxperm
* The only supported operation is ioctl
* The only supported xperm_set format is range ([low-high])

Type 3:
"<rule_name> class"
Rules: create, permissive, enforcing

Type 4:
"attradd class attribute"

Type 5:
"<rule_name> source_type target_type class default_type"
Rules: type_transition, type_change, type_member

Type 6:
"name_transition source_type target_type class default_type object_name"

Notes:
* Type 4 - 6 does not support collections
* Object classes cannot be collections
* source_type and target_type can also be attributes

Example: allow { s1 s2 } { t1 t2 } class *
Will be expanded to:

allow s1 t1 class { all permissions }
allow s1 t2 class { all permissions }
allow s2 t1 class { all permissions }
allow s2 t2 class { all permissions }
```

Options:
  -c, --command COMMAND         pass COMMAND to the invoked shell
  -h, --help                    display this help message and exit
  -, -l, --login                pretend the shell to be a login shell
