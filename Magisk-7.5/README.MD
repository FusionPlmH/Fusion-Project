# Magisk

[Downloads](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases) \| [Documentation](https://topjohnwu.github.io/Magisk/) \| [XDA Thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/official-magisk-v7-universal-systemless-t3473445)

## Introduction

Magisk is a suite of open source tools for customizing Android, supporting devices higher than Android 4.2 (API 17). It covers the fundamental parts for Android customization: root, boot scripts, SELinux patches, AVB2.0 / dm-verity / forceencrypt removals etc.

Furthermore, Magisk provides a **Systemless Interface** to alter the system (or vendor) arbitrarily while the actual partitions stay completely intact. With its systemless nature along with several other hacks, Magisk can hide modifications from nearly any system integrity verifications used in banking apps, corporation monitoring apps, game cheat detections, and most importantly [Google's SafetyNet API](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/index.html).

## Bug Reports

**Make sure to install the latest [Canary Build](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/dev-magisk-canary-channel-bleeding-edge-t3839337) before reporting any bugs!** **DO NOT** report bugs that are already fixed upstream. Follow the instructions in the [Canary Channel XDA Thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/dev-magisk-canary-channel-bleeding-edge-t3839337), and report a bug either by [opening an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/issues) or directly in the thread.

## Building Environment Requirements

-  Python 3: run `build.py` script
-  Java Development Kit (JDK) 8: Compile Magisk Manager and sign zips
-  Latest Android SDK: set `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to the path to Android SDK
-  Android NDK: Install NDK along with SDK (`$ANDROID_HOME/ndk-bundle`), or optionally specify a custom path `ANDROID_NDK_HOME`
-  (Windows Only) Python package Colorama: Install with `pip install colorama`, used for ANSI color codes

## Building Notes and Instructions

-  Clone sources with submodules: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk.git`
-  Building is supported on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Official releases are built and tested with [FrankeNDK](https://github.com/topjohnwu/FrankeNDK); point `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` to FrankeNDK if you want to use it for compiling.
-  Set configurations in `config.prop`. A sample file `config.prop.sample` is provided as an example.
-  Run `build.py` with argument `-h` to see the built-in help message. The `-h` option also works for each supported actions, e.g. `./build.py binary -h`
-  By default, `build.py` build binaries and Magisk Manager in debug mode. If you want to build Magisk Manager in release mode (via the `-r, --release` flag), you need a Java Keystore file `release-key.jks` (only `JKS` format is supported) to sign APKs and zips. For more information, check out [Google's Official Documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html#signing-manually).

## Translations

Default string resources for Magisk Manager and its stub APK are located here:

- `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`
- `stub/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`

Translate each and place them in the respective locations (`[module]/src/main/res/values-[lang]/strings.xml`).

## Signature Verification

Official release zips and APKs are signed with my personal private key. You can verify the key certificate to make sure the binaries you downloaded are not manipulated in anyway.

``` bash
# Use the keytool command from JDK to print certificates
keytool -printcert -jarfile <APK or Magisk zip>

# The output should contain the following signature
Owner: CN=John Wu, L=Taipei, C=TW
Issuer: CN=John Wu, L=Taipei, C=TW
Serial number: 50514879
Valid from: Sun Aug 14 13:23:44 EDT 2016 until: Tue Jul 21 13:23:44 EDT 2116
Certificate fingerprints:
	 MD5:  CE:DA:68:C1:E1:74:71:0A:EF:58:89:7D:AE:6E:AB:4F
	 SHA1: DC:0F:2B:61:CB:D7:E9:D3:DB:BE:06:0B:2B:87:0D:46:BB:06:02:11
