<b>•Lock Screen Time Component•</b>
<br>
Samsung's official default lock screen time component is in the AOD (Information Screen) APK, now you can switch to the UI time component <br>
<b>•You may not understand the place•</b>
<br>
1. The time component that is switched to the UI (we call it the custom time component) cannot apply the clock style setting, and needs to switch to the AOD time component<br>
2. Custom time widgets, the theme in the set theme store may cause the lunar calendar not to be displayed. In the face of this problem, you only need to change a wallpaper, it is a wallpaper, and the lock screen is OK<br>
3. In the custom time widget, set some font styles, plus the adjustment of the font size may lead to incomplete font display, for this case, you can change a font <br>
<b>•Warm reminder•</b>
<br>
Adjust the hour and minute size. There is a distinction between the horizontal row (displayed when there is a lock screen notification event) and the vertical style (normal standby style) setting size is not confused <br>
